    //Here there will be different public gameobjects which will be Prefabs. Depending on the colour that player picks the building will add an amount to that stat.

    //Player cycles through the colours on the building and once they are satisfied they press a button and that "builds" the player's starting stats
    //Or player cycles through colour but each time they change colour it Contradicts the last statement so instead of + 10 to Orange its -10 to Orange but +10 to whatever colour it is now 
    //Colour Pointer, look at building with a colour pointer selected and paint that building that colour.

	void Start () {

	// Update is called once per frame
	void Update () {
